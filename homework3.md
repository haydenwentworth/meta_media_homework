##100 Ideas That Changed the Web

#Idea No. 12: Bulletin Board Systems

*In the early days of the Internet, different communities from gamers to artists to journalists to fans of various things started their own BBSs. What are some examples of early BBSs that aren't mentioned in the book. Support your answer with sources. (extra props if you can find a BBS that is still active and you can figure out how to visit it!)*

Something they did not mention in the book was CBBS which was "the software that allowed personal-computer owners with modems to dial-in to a dedicated system and leave messages that others would see later, when they, in turn, dialed up the BBS." With this software you could do it where ever but since people had to pay for long distance people tended to stay within a small radius. (I also added a link to the original handbook or guid to the first BBS)

#Idea No. 36: GeoCities

*The book mentions that Yahoo! purchased GeoCities and that, because they were loosing money on it, Yahoo! would eventually announce that they would be shutting it down. However, it did not mention the fact that this announcement was made only a few months before the shut down. Yahoo! would be deleting all the data on the GeoCities servers, this meant thousands of early user generated websites would disappear from the Internet forever. Fortunately, some folks found those websites to be important and valuable pieces of Internet history and took action to try and preserve some of these sites. Who are these people? What did they do to save GeoCities? Support your answer with sources.*

The two main people/organizations that wanted to save the history behind the GeoCities where Internet Archive,  InternetArchaeology.org, and Reocities. Reocities tried their best to download as much content before the shutdown in 2009 but they did not get to download everything. On the Internet Archives website you can type in a Geocites and it will take you to it.All of the organizations believed GeoCities where a huge part of tech history.
