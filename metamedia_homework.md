##Self driving cars
	Self driving cars have been a new accessible technology in the past couple of years.
  Tesla made the first self driving car a regular person could buy and use. I think this is very
  interesting because me personally I drive everywhere I couldn't imagine something else driving me
  places while I'm in the driver's seat. There have been reports of accidents with the self driving
  car recently concerning sensors on the car.

##GPS
	Kids growing up in the 21st century do not have the freedom like some of us did GPS wasn’t accessible
  like it is now. GPS is on every phone, laptop, car etc. and the list keeps getting longer. You can track
  anyone that has snapchat, find my iPhone, facebook, instagram, and many other apps that are on your electronic
   devices. This in my opinion people need to be very careful with because anyone can track you. I bet in the
   next ten years we will be putting chips into our bodies (like a dogs) so we can track people even more.

##Social networking
	Nowadays people have a Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to document their
  everyday life. A majority of people on this earth spend most of their time looking down at
  their phones checking their social media to see what everyone is up to. This can hurt our social
  skills tremendously and it kind of already has. People are obsessed with their image online hoping
  they will get noticed or get the approval they need from other people from them commenting on their posts.

##Real time language translation
	I think this invention is probably the most useful and most interesting out of all the ones I have
  listed. I feel as if I have seen something like this in a move, hearing someone talk then automatically
  getting it translated without a professional translator. This product will make business deals and any
   other kind of deal much smoother than without this product. Learning a language was always the hardest
   subject for me in high school and I think having this tool can make life so much easier. (I wish I had
   his in my Spanish class in high school)

##Internet influencers
	I personally don’t think internet influences are an odd thing but the older generations might.
  An internet influencer is someone online with a following, they can literally have no talent and be
  somewhat famous. Honestly if you have a good body or are funny then you will most likely have a following.
  Internet influencers get paid millions just by endorsing a product on their instagram or getting their
  AdCents from Youtube.
