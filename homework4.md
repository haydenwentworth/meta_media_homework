*Now that you've been researching your topic for a couple of weeks I want you to try and imagine what
the future of the world with this idea/technology in it could be. Produce two fictional diary entries
from the point of view of two fictional future folks. Imagine what the next 5 or 10 years of development
in this technology will look like. Based on your predictions, you will answer the questions:

Who will benefit most from this technology and who will be disadvantaged most? Write two speculative
diary entries from the point of views of someone from each group. These should focus on the day to day
personal life of these hypothetical individuals but should clearly illustrate what it might be like in
the future for this person to live in a world with this particular technology. Push your two future
diary posts to your homework repo on GitHub.*

#FUTURE 1 - 5 years

Today sucked. This morning I got a nonfiction from instagram telling me I lost over 1,000 followers. My life is over, I literally had 5,003,456 now I have 5,002,122. All of my friends have at least 8,000,000 followers on instagram, I honestly don't know why my numbers are dropping. I just posted a bikini pic yesterday. I also haven't been getting as much brand deals as I did last month. I feel like in the past five years everyone and their fish (literary) are on some kind of platform. It's seriously ridiculous I remember when you didn't have to post about everything you do throughout the day. Life was so much simpler. It's so hard keeping up with your body image too because everyone is trying to look out for face tune these days. It's also so hard keeping up with everyone online. One day it's a dude getting mauled by a lion then the next it's Kylie Jenner is with her new baby daddy. Everything I do online is not me and I am so tired of it, but I know if I stop I will get so much backlash from my friends at school. I wish I could just escape but I know my social media statues will come and haunt me.

#FUTURE 2 - 10 years

Today I had a meeting at work about how our company needs to get more internet influencers endorsing our products. Last month we hit our sales goal of 4.5 million and this month we made 5 million in sales. My company has many internet influencers backing our product which is probably the main reason for the increase in sales. Since Facebook and regular cable shutdown the older generation is not getting our product ads. People where so invested in streaming sites that they shutdown regular cable this makes it so much harder to get to curtain age groups. We usually hire lots of young people to endorse our product but maybe we need to reach out to the old influencers so we can reach the 30-40 year olds. The sales market is getting harder and harder to sell on. With so many different products with social media backing, I honestly don't know what our next move is going to be. I wish it was like it used to be, like simple ads on the TV. But since the media has blown up in the past 15 years people tend to spend more money especially online. When I got home my daughters where watching their favorite YouTubers on the TV. Since YouTube has regulated their videos so much I have a peace of mind letting them just go on their without my supervision. I try to regulate their time on their phones because of how much they are invested into other peoples lives online. I have to keep constantly telling them its all fake but they still don't believe me. One of my daughters told me she wanted to be an instagramer when she grew up. They might make a ton of money but I could never let that happen. I've notice many young teens not going to collage or dropping out of high-school because they think they can make tons of money online. It's sad to think about our future generation because I think everyday they just get dumber and dumber because they are so invested in other peoples lives and not their own. But I honestly can't complain because if it weren't for those internet influencers I wouldn't be where I am today.
