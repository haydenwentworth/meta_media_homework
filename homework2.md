#Readings

*In your own words explain what the Internet is and how it came to be. Give both a technical explanation (that a regular person would understand) as well as historical context.*

The internet was an idea that started to surface around the early 20th century. Paul Otlet was the founder of the Mundaneum which was a system that held information about books, newspapers, pictures, posters etc. He had tons of flashcards that had this information on them that you could just pull from ('network of documents'), he called them 'links'. These links on the documents where all connected together. Olet called this system the 'Semantic Web'. About 15ish years later the space race came to be after WW2. The Russians sent out a satellite into space, Sputnik. The Americans were not so happy so the government started funneling all of this money into the science programs. Joseph Licklider created the Intergalactic Computer Network and Paul Baran help to create the communications systems which would be used in space. This would divid messages so they can be sent to wherever then comeback to gather for the receiver to read. The first message was sent in 1969 at the University of California. The first thing to be sent was the letters 'L' AND 'O' then the system crashed. Later on Vannevar Bush (director of the Manhattan Project) came up with Memex which was a memory machine. Bushes idea got published in an article. Later on Douglas Engelburt came across this article and came up with oNline System (NLS) based off of Bushes ideas. Around the same time Ted Nelson came up with an idea to eliminated paper which resulted in the World Wide Web. Nelson introduced Xanadu which is a 'different kind of computer world' where you would have flying pages, deep interconnection, and parallel inter-comparison. This inspired Apples hypermedia software. In 1971  ARPANET (the system created to survive the nuclear attacks during the time of the space race) nodes where put all over the US and other countries. In 1977 a successful test was done that sent messages all over, this meant people could communicate from far places this resulted in the operational internet. Scientist adopted 'packet switching networks' which made it possible to switch networks. From then on people could send email, talk online, play games, and internet providers rose in the industry. Robert Khan had the idea of joining all of these things together so they could talk to each other. In the 80's public networks joined the internet but commercial traffic was not allowed. Lastly Hedy Kiestler came up with the idea of radio signals that could hop frequencies in 1940. A year later she patient the idea but did not become reality until a university in Hawaii wanted to send messages to different islands. Later on in 1999 the term Wifi came to be.   


#Research: Internet Influencers

*Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for?How does it work?*

Internet Influencers are changing the marketing industry and social networking. 'A social media influencer has access to a large audience and can persuade others by virtue of their authenticity and reach.' (https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-social-media-influencer) An influencers main task is to persuade their audience in to thinking whatever they want. This can range from endorsements from companies to thinking their life is all unicorns and rainbows. Influencers have platforms on ,and not limited to, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and the biggest one is YouTube. They do not just endorse products but they also share their life on the internet which makes the younger generation relate to them more (this also builds up their following). For example, Anastasia Karanikolaou is a huge influencer with 3.3 million followers on instagram alone. Say she posted a photo about a clothing brand (which she has done before) people will use her link which gives her a percentage of what ever the customer buys.

*Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names,
briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.*

I would say the big internet platforms are Youtube, Instagram, Vine (RIP), and Twitter. I can't really name any people because my list would be way too long but their are some people that started the trend of being an internet influencer. The biggest one that pops into my mind would have to be Kylie Jenner (https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/?hl=en). Without Instagram I don't think she would be as influential as she is now. For YouTube there are many influencers that paved the way like Shane Dawson and Jenna Marbles which have been making videos for over 10 years, they turned their YouTube channels into a job.

*What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they
seem particularly noteworthy?*

A big mile stone for the technology would be the option to make money off of these social networking platforms. I feel if the influencers didn't have the option to make money they would not take part in the social networking sites. Putting time and effort into something that won't benefit someone in the future doesn't drive people todo something.   

*Draw (literally or figuratively) connections between the technology you are researching and other
related technology. This could include subcategories within your research area and/or technological
predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area.*

As I mentioned before being an Internet Influencer you have to have some kind of platform like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter etc. and you have to have some kind of device that can hold these platforms like a phone and or computer. Being able to make money is a huge factor of an influencer and their are many ways like Patreon, Adcents, gofund me etc. (https://www.bustle.com/articles/103239-how-do-youtubers-make-money-a-pro-youtuber-explains-just-how-the-whole-system-works) These are the many apps and companies that influencers have to go through in order to make their money.
