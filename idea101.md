## INTERNET INFLUENCERS

Internet influencers are the  new celebrities of the 21st century. In the past twenty years social media has boomed with millions of people making accounts and living online. Most recently Internet influencers have become the new talk of the town. Internet Influencers essentially share their life online, either it be through photos, videos, or comments. The primary social media platforms are YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.The main demographic of their followers depending on the type of content they produce is mainly young teenagers and young adults. These online influencers give people a personal glimpse into their lives. It is like being personal with a person without even meeting them in real life. This can benefit the viewer but also impair them. The viewer feels closer to them because they are more reachable then an average celebrity.Unfortunately, the viewers sometimes the viewer get way to invested into these influencers and then do not develop the social skills they need because influencers are so personal and reachable. Over time we will see the social effects on the younger generation.  
The social media platforms use a system so the influencer can make a living. Adcents and endorsements. Influencers get paid up to a couple of thousand dollars just to post one picture of a product. What is so amazing about this way of advertising is that their followers are most likely going to spend their money. Regular celebrities endorse products all the time but internet influencers have a better chance of getting their audience engage because of how personal and reatable they are. Adcents is based on how many views/clicks a the ad gets. Some influencers do for the money and other just do it because they love what they do.
On the other side of things the Internet Influencers have a hard time dealing with the hate and balancing their actual life with filming/vlogging, posting, and commenting.
